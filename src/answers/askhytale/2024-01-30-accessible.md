title: Will there be accessibility options?
question: Will there be accessibility options? for example, I'm deaf, I like subtitles for sounds, my brother can't read small texts, some people have ADHD, and they like visuals that predict where a bomb will explode, the size, or when an enemy will attack, just to focus.
answer: Hey Lusia! We believe in every person's Right To Play and we aspire for Hytale to be as accessible to as many as possible! Implementing features such as subtitles for dialouge and captions for non-speech sounds is high on our priority list. But we are also consciously designing with accessibility in mind, so that our systems are not inaccessible to begin with. For example, we use multiple sensory methods to deliver essential gameplay info, so that we don't rely on audio alone.
