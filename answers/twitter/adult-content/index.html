        <p>Q: What do you can says about censorship and adult content in our worlds? we can set an age restriction on our worlds?</p>
        <p>A: I don&#39;t think it will surprise anyone to hear that we will not be putting adult content in Hytale. We will also have parental controls to help protect children from adult content.</p>
